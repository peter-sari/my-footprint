DESCRIPTION
My Footprint is a website to demonstrate the idea of the impact of our behaviour on the world we live in. Following a registration visitors complete a questionaire about their consumption. Based on our proprietary scoring we give a colour coded feedback on the impact. When no user is logged in we show the average result of all answers. The website main page also promotes some relevant charities.

REASONS OF CHOSING THIS TASK
We worked in a pair to simulate a co-working situation. Using Heroku and Github we created a collaborative environment to simulate a real-world like project environment. We decided to build a web application to practice skills neded for:
- designing website logic using Pyton to create dynamic pages, including calculations from data in runtime
- using SQL to store data, including password hashed securely
- user sessions securely managed at server side
- using json to to include file use and ensure the opportunity to amend with external content through an API
- using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the front-end
